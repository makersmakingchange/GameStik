The "GameStik" is a mouth operated gaming joystick based on the LipSync which is being developed to allow quadriplegics and other people with limited hand use the ability to play video games by manipulation of a mouth-operated joystick with integrated sip and puff controls.

This GitHub repository will serve as a database for all software files associated with the GameStik and the rest of the files will be based on the LipSync.
